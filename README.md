# deriver

A project that attempts to implement the idea of a derivitave (Calculus) in javascript. User input is parsed and the derivitave is given.

Concerns
- How to parse input? What counts as a 'term'? What to do about parentheses?
- Many different rules for derivatives

Also to help Jason understand
- Functional Programming
- CSS
- Pitfalls of jQuery
- Basics of saving and loading data from a Database
- Git workflow (Pulling, pushing, merge conflicts)
